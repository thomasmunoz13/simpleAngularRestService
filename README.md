# Simple REST API Service for AngularJS

This is a AngularJS Service that I made for one of my school project ([amudrive](https://github.com/SKNZ/amudrive)).
I made this because there is no "simple" way to call a REST API in Angular JS (I mean simply by calling a function) and the others solutions
([restangular](https://github.com/mgonto/restangular) for example) aren't easy to use for an "AngularJS beginner" like me. 
It's not perfect but it was really useful for me, so if you see any bug(s) or improvement to make, please feel free to contact me or 
make a pull request.

**May the force be with you ...**
